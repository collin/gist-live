- change_callback is called one time at the beginning event if the text has not changed
- check later init call with safari 3
- improve callback documentation.

/***** To do Optionnal*****/

- possibility to switch on/off line numbers (allow to get more space)
- remove the bottom scrollbar is there is no neeed to get one. (adjust the width to the real content width). There is allways horizontal scrollbar even if no content.
- amelioration of the scroll_to_view function for when there is several lines selected (center a little more the selected text)
- darken background of the selection when syntax highlight is on (not easy to see actually under firefox)
- improve opera 9 compatibility (very hard, need help for workaround) cf "Browser remarks".
- optimize scroll_to_view for Opera?
- add word wrap option (nearly impossible, there is too much lacks of support from browsers, have spend more than 6 hours on this)
- possibility to add larger font sizes as options?

/*** Bugs ***/

- when pressing "reset highlight" in IE the textarea scroll to the top (don't know how to fix this...)
- when pressing "shift+page down"  and then "shift+page up" the top of the selection move where as it should be to the bottom of the selection to move (to fix it: must know in which direction the selection grow in "get_selection_infos")
- Editor doesnt load when running on ASP.NET when using codebehind declaration at top of page (don't really know what to do because I don't know ASP nor .NET)


/*** Problems ***/


/*** Highlight bugs ***/

/*** Highlight problems ***/
- only one language at the same time (no html and php in the same textarea. This should be possible, but there would have no optimization and be very very slow)


/*** Global remarks ***/
- editarea must be always visible, to hide it use the hide() function

/*** Browser remarks/bugs ***/

OPERA:
- opera bug or spec problem: find how to get the textarea content width
- opera bug: pressing the " key is equals to pressing the scrolldown key (with french keyboard at least)
- currently disabled: scrollDown/Up function (due to the " key error)
- opera is very very slow with syntax highlight (regexp)
- opera doesn't render tabulation of the same width in a textarea as in a <pre> tag... => doesn't allow to use non monospace font
- opera doesn't manage correctly the width 100% for the iframe and allow to scroll with position absolute

IE:
- IE is far slower than firefox in highlight mode due to opacity filter
- It's seems impossible to get the selection range when wrap mode is "soft" (and it's still very diffcult when wrap mode is on)
- The syntax highlight mode is broken when text length is too long (~100000, 150000 chars) don't know why...

FIREFOX:
- the scrollHeight value for the textarea never decresease when lines are deleted (don't remember anything about this)


NETSCAPE:
- can't manage lineHeight for textarea in firefox mode
- setting highlight mode on crash the navigator with no warning in firefox mode
